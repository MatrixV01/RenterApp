# RNTR

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nodedoubt/cinemaplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RNTR/RenterApp)

The RNTR web platform allows users to search their community for tools, household items, sports equippment, or almost anything else and rent it by the day from neighbors. Alternatively, RNTR allows users to rent out their underutilized posessions, turning junk into a revenue stream.

## Getting Started

    $ npm install
    $ webpack
    $ npm start

## Stack

 - PostgreSQL
 - Knex.js
 - Node.js
 - Express.js
 - React.js

## Tests

The RNTR backend was developed via TDD using Mocha and Chai. To run the test suite:
```
$ createdb RNTR_test
$ npm test
```

See ```Database Setup``` for more information.

## Continuous Integration

On every pull request, Travis will automatically run and perform the following:

 - Clone from the pull request.
 - Read the travis.yml file from the root directory of the repo.
 - Run npm install.
 - Start the server.
 - Run tests from the test directory.

If any of the above fail, Travis will report what went wrong on the Github pull request page.
If all of the above succeed, Travis will autodeploy to production when the pull request is merged to DEV-BRANCH.

##Database
See ```Database Setup```.

## Road Map
  - In-app messaging for users
  - Rental confirmation/rejection options for item owners
  - Rental cancellation option for users
  - Delete Items and Delete Account option for users
  - User rating/review system
  - Booking items by-the-hour
  - Email notifications
  - In-app notifications
  - Filter searches by item category, condition, and availability dates
  - Payment processing integration (Paypal, Venmo)
  - Enhanced UI for displaying item availability
  - 'Request an Item' functionality
  - City-specific home pages

## Database Setup

- Install postgress:
	
	``` $ brew install postgresql ```

- Initialize a pg instance via terminal:
	
	``` $ postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres ```

- Create a local database for RNTR via terminal:
	
	``` $ createdb RNTR_dev ```

- Run server.js:
	
	``` $ npm start ```

- To query a local database from terminal once a postgres instance is running:
	
	``` $ psql RNTR_dev ```

## Known Bugs

- CLIENT: The 'Sign up', 'Sign in', 'Submit Listing', and 'Rent This Item' buttons interrupt asyncronous processes the first time they are clicked after page load. As a temporary workaround, if you are in a view containing one of these buttons, click the button once after page load prior to filling out or submitting any information.

	``` EXAMPLE: Prior to signing up, click the 'Sign up' button. Then fill out the name, password, and email fields and click the 'Sign up' button again. ```
